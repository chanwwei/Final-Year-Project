## Diploma in Information Technology 
**Title: The Vacuum Cleaner Robot 2.0 - FSR-based Robotic Vacuum Cleaner**

The aim of this project is to develop a robotic vacuum cleaner which uses Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) as obstacle detection sensor to carry out cleaning task.
The objective of this project are shown as follows:

i. Research about the working principle and type of force sensors available

ii. Identify the most appropriate components to construct the vacuum cleaner 

robot such as the sensor, motor, microcontroller, control circuit, fan and 
software, etc

iii. Write algorithm that control the movement of vacuum cleaner robot 

iv. Assemble the hardware components according to the circuit diagram
